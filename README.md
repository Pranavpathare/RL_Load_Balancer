# RL_Load_Balancer
Project : Reinforcement Learning Based Auto Load Balancing + Auto Scaling   
Reinforcement Learning Operated / Optimised Application Load Balancer and Auto Scaler similar to what AWS implements (for EC2 Instances).  
At a later stage we would also like to build the traditional load balancing algorithm based models - Consistent Hashing, Round Robin, Least connections, Least Response time and have a comparison (Graph Based). 
Build a GUI based implementation on a webpage. 
The webpage will be hosted on an EC2 instance.
